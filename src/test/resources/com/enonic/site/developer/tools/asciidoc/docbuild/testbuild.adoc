== Usage

To use this library in your JavaScript code, you first need to require it:

[source,js]
----
var xsltLib = require('/lib/xslt');
----

Then, you will need to find the view.  For instance, if you have a part, Fruit, you resolve the part with:

[source,js]
----
var view = resolve('view/fruit.xslt');
----

All the variables used in the view must be gathered, from request objects, back-end storage or whatever source you want to use.  These should be put into a JSon object that is sent to the render function:

[source,js]
----
var model = {
    fruits: [
        {
            name: 'Apple',
            color: 'Red'
        },
        {
            name: 'Pear',
            color: 'Green'
        }
    ]
};
var result = xsltLib.render(view, model);
----


== API

This lib have only one method:

=== `render`

This will create a document, based on the template in the view, and the content in the model.  Normally this is an HTML-document, but XSL may be used to create text-documents of any type.

*Parameters*

* `view` (_object_) Location of the view. Use resolve(..) to resolve a view.
* `model` (_object_) Model that is passed to the view.


== Compatibility

This library is a drop-in replacement for the library in Enonic XP released before 6.11.0. It can be used directly since it will work by using `/lib/xslt`, `/lib/xp/xslt` and `/site/lib/xp/xslt`.
